	abstract = {This paper presents Daft-Exprt, a multi-speaker acoustic model advancing the state-of-the-art on inter-speaker and inter-text prosody transfer. This improvement is achieved using FiLM conditioning layers, alongside adversarial training that encourages disentanglement between prosodic information and speaker identity. The acoustic model inherits attractive qualities from FastSpeech 2, such as fast inference and local prosody attributes prediction for finer grained control over generation. Experimental results show that Daft-Exprt significantly outperforms strong baselines on prosody transfer tasks, while yielding naturalness comparable to state-of-the-art expressive models. Moreover, results indicate that adversarial training effectively discards speaker identity information from the prosody representation, which ensures Daft-Exprt will consistently generate speech with the desired voice. We publicly release our code and provide speech samples from our experiments.},

The motion style generated by the model is extracted from an exemplar motion clip. Style is embedded in a latent space using a variational framework. This architecture allows for generating in styles unseen during training. Moreover, the probabilistic nature of our variational framework furthermore enables the generation of a variety of outputs given the same input, addressing the stochastic nature of gesture motion. The GENEA challenge evaluation showed that our model produces full-body motion with highly competitive levels of human-likeness.},

	abstract = {© 2012 IEEE. A growing number of applications, e.g., video surveillance and medical image analysis, require training recognition systems from large amounts of weakly annotated data, while some targeted interactions with a domain expert are allowed to improve the training process. In such cases, active learning (AL) can reduce labeling costs for training a classifier by querying the expert to provide the labels of most informative instances. This paper focuses on AL methods for instance classification problems in multiple instance learning (MIL), where data are arranged into sets, called bags, which are weakly labeled. Most AL methods focus on single-instance learning problems. These methods are not suitable for MIL problems because they cannot account for the bag structure of data. In this paper, new methods for bag-level aggregation of instance informativeness are proposed for multiple instance AL (MIAL). The aggregated informativeness method identifies the most informative instances based on classifier uncertainty and queries bags incorporating the most information. The other proposed method, called cluster-based aggregative sampling, clusters data hierarchically in the instance space. The informativeness of instances is assessed by considering bag labels, inferred instance labels, and the proportion of labels that remain to be discovered in clusters. Both proposed methods significantly outperform reference methods in extensive experiments using benchmark data from several application domains. Results indicate that using an appropriate strategy to address MIAL problems yields a significant reduction in the number of queries needed to achieve the same level of performance as single-instance AL methods.},

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
