Ubisoft had published a [blog page](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/studio/laforge/news/5ADkkY0BMG9vNSDuUMtkeg/zeroeggs-zeroshot-examplebased-gesture-generation-from-speech) describing our system for gesture generation conditioned on speech.
\
This system was presented in ["ZeroEGGS: Zero-shot Example-based Gesture Generation from Speech"](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/cgf.14734) and showcased on [2 minute papers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt0cA2phKfU&ab_channel=TwoMinutePapers).
