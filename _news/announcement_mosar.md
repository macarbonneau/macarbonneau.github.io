We are excited to share our recent work on monocular 3D face reconstruction that will be presented at [CVPR 2024](https://cvpr.thecvf.com/). We introduce [MoSAR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13091), a new method that turns a portrait image into a realistic 3D avatar. 
\
\
From a single image, MoSAR estimates a detailed mesh and texture maps at 4K resolution, capturing pore-level details. This avatar can be rendered from any viewpoint and under different lighting condition. 
\
\
We are also releasing a new dataset called FFHQ-UV-Intrinsics. This is the first dataset that offer rich intrinsic face attributes (diffuse, specular, ambient occlusion and translucency) at high resolution for 10K subjects.
