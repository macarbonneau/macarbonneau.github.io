This is the recording of the presentation that I gave at the 2021 Game Developers Conference on ["speech synthesis applied to videogames"](https://gdcvault.com/play/1027229/Speech-Synthesis-in-the-Context).

Generating spoken dialog lines artificially could prove to be pivotal for the future of the gaming industry. Aside from reducing production costs, it offers opportunities for new types of in-games interactions closer to real-world experiences. The goal of the talk is to present an honest snapshot of the state of the technology, discuss remaining challenges and possible present and future use cases. We demonstrate how current commercial speech synthesis solutions do not directly apply to the gaming context where voice require a high level of expressivity. We discuss present solutions to control expressivity, and how we use speech synthesis at Ubisoft.
