Our paper ["Rhythm Modeling for Voice Conversion"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10246359) has been published in IEEE Signal Processing Letters. We also released it on [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06040). 
\
In this paper we model the natural rhythm of speakers to perform conversion while respecting the target speaker's natural rhythm. We do more than approximating the global speech rate, we model duration for sonorants, obstruents, and silences.
