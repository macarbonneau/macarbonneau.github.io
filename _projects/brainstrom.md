This an art project from [Jean Dubois](https://www.jeandubois.info/). 
We built an interactive projection controlled by an anemometer. The words were bouncing around on actual landmark on the projected surface.

It was presented at the Biennale de Montréal (2011) and during "À Montréal, quand l’image rôde" at Le Fresnoy - Studio national des arts contemporains in France (2013)
