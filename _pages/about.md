Welcome to my page! 

This site contains information regarding my research and some personal projects
Here's a subset of my research interests:
- Machine learning
- Speech processing
- Disentangled representations
- Multiple instance learning
- Computer vision


Since 2017, I work as a research scientist at Ubisoft in the [La Forge lab](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/studio/laforge). 
I lead a group of resarchers applying the latest techniques in machine learning, speech, signal processingm, computer vision & graphics, animation to video games.

Before that, as a PhD student, I was affiliated with two labs:
- LIVIA - [Laboratory for Imagery, Vision and Artificial Intelligence](https://liviamtl.ca/)
- LACIME - [Communication and Microelectronic Integration Laboratory](https://www.etsmtl.ca/unites-de-recherche/lacime/accueil?lang=en-CA)
