Welcome to my page! 

This site contains information regarding my research and some personal projects.

Iâ€™m passionate about using the latest advances in machine learning, speech and signal processing, and visual computing to push the boundaries of video games.

I currently work as a senior research scientist at [Epic Games](https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/home).
Before that, I acted as principal research scientist at Ubisoft in the [La Forge lab](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/studio/laforge) between 2017 and 2025.
